# Sales Copilot AI Agent

An AI-powered sales research assistant designed to help sales representatives prepare effectively for sales calls through structured research and strategic insights.

This project focuses on improving pre-call preparation by combining company research, prospect analysis, and strategic synthesis into a single AI-driven workflow.

## Problem

Sales teams often prepare for calls under tight time constraints.
Research is scattered across tabs, LinkedIn profiles are skimmed, and talking points remain generic.

As a result, sales conversations begin without proper context.

---

## Solution

The Sales Copilot AI Agent automates pre-call preparation.

Given a company website and a prospect’s LinkedIn profile, the agent produces:
- A concise, sales ready company overview
- A resume-style prospect summary
- A structured pre-call strategy with talking points, objections, and conversation starters

The goal is not to sell harder, but to enter calls informed.
